;;; Commentary:

;; This package is built on top of `register.el' and allows you to quickly jump
;; to the next/previous position register.  If you reach the end, the search
;; wraps around and continues with the first (or last) register.  It can be used
;; across all files or individually for each buffer.

;; Features:
;;
;; * Cycle through all position registers in both directions.
;; * Clear current register.
;; * Store point in unused register (range configurable).
;; * Clear all registers in the unused registers range.

;; Installation:
;;
;; **Note:** The function and variable names were previously separated by “/”
;; from the namespace.  To conform with MELPA rules the separator has been
;; changed to “-”.
;;
;; To use `register-quicknav.el', get it from
;; [MELPA](https://melpa.org/#/register-quicknav) or put it in your load-path
;; and add the following to your init.el:
;;
;; (require 'register-quicknav)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "<C-f5>") #'register-quicknav-prev-register)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "<C-f6>") #'register-quicknav-next-register)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "<C-f7>") #'register-quicknav-point-to-unused-register)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "<C-S-<f7>") #'register-quicknav-clear-current-register)
;;
;; Or, with use-package:
;;
;; (use-package register-quicknav
;;   :bind (("C-<f5>"   . register-quicknav-prev-register)
;;          ("C-<f6>"   . register-quicknav-next-register)
;;          ("C-<f7>"   . register-quicknav-point-to-unused-register)
;;          ("C-S-<f7>" . register-quicknav-clear-current-register)))

;; Variables:
;;
;; * `register-quicknav-buffer-only': Cycle only through position registers in
;;   current buffer.  Can be safely set as file- and/or dir-local variable.
;; * `register-quicknav-unused-registers-begin': Beginning of the range that is
;;   used to search for unused registers.  Defaults to `?A'.
;; * `register-quicknav-unused-registers-end': End of the range that is used to
;;   search for unused registers.  Defaults to `?Z'.

;; Differences to similar packages:
;;
;; [iregister](https://github.com/atykhonov/iregister.el):
;;
;; * Opens a minibuffer on each jump (thereby requiring an extra keystroke).
;; * Doesn't work with file-query registers
;; * Can't be restricted to the current buffer.
;; * Doesn't look like it's still maintained.
;;
;; [register-channel](https://github.com/YangZhao11/register-channel):
;;
;; * Is limited to 5 position registers by default, needs an extra keybinding
;;   for each additional register.
;; * Can't be restricted to the current buffer.
;; * Has no ability to jump to the next/previous register.
